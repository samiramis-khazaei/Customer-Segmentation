# Customer Segmentation 
### Problem Statement:<br>
In today's dynamic business landscape, industries aim not only to attract new customers but also to retain their existing ones. Given the uniqueness of each customer, employing a one-size-fits-all approach is ineffective. Therefore, it is more effective for companies to categorize their customers based on their attributes and behaviours, aligning their marketing approaches closely with the characteristics of similar customer groups. The process of categorizing customers based on shared behaviour or attributes is called customer segmentation.
The objective of this project is to develop a customer segmentation model for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail business specializing in unique all-occasion gifts, with a significant portion of its customer base consisting of wholesalers. The model employs the RFM framework, assessing Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value as key indicators for analysing customer behaviour. These three dimensions aid in identifying distinct customer groups with similar characteristics.
